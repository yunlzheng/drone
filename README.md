Drone is a Continuous Integration platform built on container technology. Every build is executed inside an ephemeral Docker container, giving developers complete control over their build environment with guaranteed isolation.

### Goals

Drone's prime directive is to help teams [ship code like GitHub](https://github.com/blog/1241-deploying-at-github#always-be-shipping). Drone is easy to install, setup and maintain and offers a powerful container-based plugin system. Drone aspires to be an industry-wide replacement for Jenkins.
